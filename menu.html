                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Julis-Alexia Marie Florentia Renate van Riessfeld is usually called Julius who graduated from Seidoukan Academy. Since I was in high school, I studied potography. I learned a lot from potography, started to adjust the camera, focus of objects, and angles of objects. From there I continued to pursue until now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now potography is an art that is occupied by many people. besides easy to learn, now potography doesn't have to have a camera, we can easily use our own smartphones. The tutorial can also be easily searched on the internet.

                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>
                    I like photographing stars at night. They are very beautiful. Where the darkness of the night is, there they emit flickering light. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    besides photographing the stars in the sky, I also like to photograph people, people will pose when my camera starts to turn on. This is very exciting.
